The main difference between the breast cancer dataset and the dry bean dataset is that we know for sure that the breast cancer dataset is linearly seperable whereas the dry bean dataset may not be. This is because the breast cancer dataset is a binary classification problem whereas the dry bean dataset is a multiclass classification problem. The breast cancer dataset is also much smaller than the dry bean dataset. The breast cancer dataset has 569 instances and 30 features whereas the dry bean dataset has 13611 instances and 17 features. The breast cancer dataset is also much more balanced than the dry bean dataset. The breast cancer dataset has 357 benign instances and 212 malignant instances whereas the dry bean dataset has 6757 instances of class 1, 3659 instances of class 2, 1155 instances of class 3, 1155 instances of class 4, 1155 instances of class 5, 1155 instances of class 6, and 1155 instances of class 7.

The dry bean dataset is a multi-classification whereas the breast cancer dataset is a binary classification problem. This meant that the dry bean dataset will requre the classifier to be more resilient to noise and may need a much more complex model to classify the data. This is quite obvious for the boosting classifier as the weak learner for the dry bena dataset is just a simple one leaf decision tree whereas the weak learner for the dry bean dataset has a maximum dpeth of 3.
