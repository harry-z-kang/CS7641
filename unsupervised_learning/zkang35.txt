HW3 is contained in `unsupervised_learning` folder.

The report can be found in `report.pdf` but the images and the text may be mismatched because pandoc doesn't know how to preserve order. A better way to read the report is to read the `zkang35-analysis.md` file rendered on GitHub.

## Dependencies
